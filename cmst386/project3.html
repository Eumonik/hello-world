          <h4>Explain the importance of responsive design and its impact on the target audience.</h4>
          <p>Serving other people through intuitive and thoughtful design provides a first-class experience and permeates through successfully. I recently finished Project 2, which required me to analyze user data from my YouTube channel over the last four years. </p>
          <h2>People are 3 times more likely to watch Eumonik YouTube videos on a MOBILE DEVICE, including phones and tablets, rather than a desktop or laptop computer!</h2>
          <p>Knowing the audience is key to communication! Knowing the fact stated above immediately becomes a paramount design principle for anything that touches the World Wide Web. Responsive design features, like media queries to resize buttons, boxes, or bars, when well implemented, become a critical aspect of harmonizing the requirements of a client with the relationship between the user and the product. "Mobile-first" is already assumed. Justifying why a website looks good on a smartphone is nearly like putting "Now even more Plant-Based!" on a tub of whole-grain oats.</p>
          <p>A great example of an app that has fully embraced this mobile-first world is BandLab. It's a free music creation platform that works on Android, iOS, and on the web. The entire experience between these three locations is seamless, like Google Docs. I almost feel silly explaining this concept at length. I'm trying to think of more to say but it's getting late.</p>

        <div class="column">
          <h4>Google Analytics provides a wealth of data for free to help assess the success of websites. Describe three different kinds of reports that will tell you what information your target audience is accessing.</h4>
          <p>As alluded to previously, I use various tools in the YouTube Studio, including audience demographics, geography, etc. to access key metrics and user behavior. I have also used Google Trends countless times to understand the search results differences between querying a keyword on YouTube compared to querying that same keyword on Google Search.</p>
          <p>Google Analytics is something I am completely unfamiliar with. After spending some time reviewing the vast collection of datasets available, developing a customized dashboard with overview-level visualizations is a positive approach. The Audience Overview, Acquisition Overview, and Mobile Overview reports have significant amounts of actionable data to shape content accordingly.</p>

            <button class="sassy" type="button" name="Learn Preprocessing">Learn Preprocessing</button>
          </a>
          <p>Create a call to action using a rounded corner button with drop shadow and make the background a gradient color; text in black or white depending on gradient background should be titled "Learn Preprocessing". </p>
