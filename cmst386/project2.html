<h2>Organization:</h2>
<img src="/cmst386/images/Eumonik_website_Diagram.jpg" alt="Eumonik.com Website Redesign Diagram">
<h4>The invitation to partner with Eumonik on the newest project is a design and business axiom.</h4>
<p>Highlighted in user experience and market strategy, the Partnerships page and linked button featured in the header navigation bar serve as the primary call-to-action and encourage the creator-to-brand relationship strategy developed to focus on audience expansion, authentic sharing of quality goods and services, and outfitting cooperative community outreach and global education in music, nature, and family.</p>
<img src="/cmst386/images/Eumonik_header.jpg" alt="Eumonik.com Header Design">
<h4>The portfolio of projects leads to Partnerships.</h4>
<p>Nested in the Projects page, archived for inspiration, a monthly-updated and separate collection of pages, spotlighting the newest project, the Mobile Music Studio Build, is framed as a journal or "Captain's Log" and fitted as a gallery to keep things organzied, well-presented, and up-to-date.</p>
<p>In strategy and concept, all paths lead to Partnerships, which is to encourage further collaboration.</p>

<p>After colleting over four years of audience data, the design and content will be aligned with the following analytics:</p>

<h2>Design:</h2>
<!-- Coolors Palette Widget -->
      <script src="https://coolors.co/palette-widget/widget.js"></script>
      <script data-id="035899148466812303">new CoolorsPaletteWidget("035899148466812303", ["290c00","ff7b00","ff9900","ffcc00","fffeeb"]); </script>

<h2>Scope:</h2>
<p>Development Process and Engagement (50-word minimum):
Are you making the website for a client (someone other than yourself?)
If you are making the website for a client, how will you involve them in the development process?
If you are making the website for yourself, what research will you perform to help you create the content of the website?
Testing (50-word minimum):
What will you do to test this website prior to launch to make sure everything you created works as designed and that your website does not contain any errors?
(Hint: This testing does not refer to HTML/CSS validation, but rather how you will test the website to make sure it is complete and meets the client requirements, including what was discovered during the development process and engagement.)
What browsers will you include in your testing?

Growth and Maintenance (50-word minimum):
How do you think the website will continue to grow and evolve over time?
What things can you do while developing the website to make it easier to maintain?
What tasks will be required to maintain the website?
At what frequency will each task you identify need to occur? (e.g. daily, once a week, once a month, etc.)

<h2>Hosting:</h2>
<p>Web Hosting (100-word minimum):Please note that you aren't required to actually register a domain name or sign up for a hosting plan
What criteria will you use to select a web host?
Note: This question does not mean identify a specific web host that you will use. Rather, it is asking you to explain how you will go through a selection process to identify which host you will use. There should always be a selection process instead of just picking any web host! Be specific in your reasoning.
What special technologies will be necessary for the website (shopping cart, SSL, etc.)? Why?
What programming and/or scripting languages will the website need to have supported? Why?
Find and identify an available domain name that would work for the website you are planning. You may use a website such as Network Solutions (http://www.netsol.com) to find an available domain name. Explain your reasoning for selecting the domain name you identified.
</p>
<h2>Security:</h2>
<p>Security (50-word minimum):
Will the website include an e-commerce component?
Will content on the website be password protected? If yes, explain what content will be password protected. If no, explain why there will not be any content that will be password protected.
Will the website have a need for users to create accounts?
While the web host will perform much of the heavy lifting on the web server to secure the website, what are some of the specific steps you can take as the website designer and developer to help secure the website?
</p>
<h2>Marketing</h2>
<p>Marketing (50-word minimum):
How will the website be marketed?
What SEO (Search Engine Optimization) elements can be covered based on what you have learned so far in the website planning and building process?</p>
<h2>Project Reflection:</h2>
<p>Project Reflection (MS Word document or paste the information in the textbox of the Assignment folder on submission) (minimum 250 words)
Respond to the following:
What applications did you use to complete the wireframes? Did you find the application simple to use or find an alternative to what was suggested?
Explain what you learned when building the flowchart diagram in the proposal?
Did you use one of the listed applications to diagram the site? If not, what did you use and why?
What challenges did you face in developing the main navigation for the final project? How did you resolve them?
