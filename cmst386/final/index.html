        I'd like to call upon Brother Jackson Browne to help us land our broken little plane through these treacherous topics:
      </h3>
      <p>Doctor, my eyes have seen the years</p>
      <p>And the slow parade of fears without crying</p>
      <p>Now I want to understand</p>
      <br>
      <p>I have done all that I could</p>
      <p>To see the evil and the good without hiding</p>
      <p>You must help me if you can</p>
      <br>
      <p>Doctor, my eyes</p>
      <p>Tell me what is wrong</p>
      <p>Was I unwise to leave them open for so long</p>
      <br>
      <p>'Cause I have wandered through this world</p>
      <p>As each moment has unfurled</p>
      <p>I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams</p>
      <br>
      <p>People go just where they will</p>
      <p>I never noticed them until I got this feeling</p>
      <p>That it's later than it seems</p>
      <br>
      <p>Doctor, my eyes</p>
      <p>Tell me what you see</p>
      <p><h1>I hear their cries!</h1></p>
      <p>Just say if it's too late for me</p>
      <br>
      <p>Doctor, my eyes</p>
      <p>Cannot see the sky</p>
      <p>Is this the prize for having learned how not to cry</p>
